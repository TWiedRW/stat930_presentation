## Soybean Background

-   Soybean is an essential crop in the United States
-   Used for food and oil
    -   Primarily for feeding livestock and producing cooking oil

![](https://cropwatch.unl.edu/soybeanMG/images/soyMan01.jpg){width="25%" fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}

Top five soybean producing states

  - Illinois
  - Iowa
  - Minnesota
  - Indiana
  - Ohio
  
About 77 percent is for animal feed, 24 percent for food products, 13.6 percent for cooking oil, 5 percent for biodiesel, and 1.4 percent for industrial uses


:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------



```{r, out.width='90%'}
p.market
```

::: {.notes}

Market share in summer months is between 3 and 20 percent

:::


------------------------------------------------------------------------



```{r, out.width='90%'}
p.yield + ggtitle('Annual Yield of Soybean')
```

::: {.notes}

BU stands for bushel, 1 BU for soybean is 60 lbs at 13 percent moisture

For the past 9 years, yield per acre is between 40 and 65 bushels per acre

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each year has its own set of conditions, but most ratings are between fair and good. 

Overall, fairly decent at the state level

# Soybean Gall Midge

## A new pest

-   In 2011, there were reports of an unidentified orange larvae on the stems of damaged soybeans after a hailstorm
-   Entomologists received reports of larvae infestations in 2018 for an unknown species causing significant damage

![](images/larvae.jpg){width="50%" fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}

No larvae samples were taken after that 2011 hailstorm, so there was nothing to compare the new larvae to 

:::

## A new pest

-   Initial surveys indicated the infestation was in Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, and Nebraska
-   As of 2020, the insect was identified in 114 counties, now including Missouri

![](images/locations.jpeg){width="75%" fig-align="center"}

## A new pest

-   Initially found on damaged plants at the end of the growing season, causing little economic concern
-   In 2018, an infestation warranted further concerns when a sample of damaged plants from earlier in the growing season had no other detectable plant diseases
-   Insects were identified as a new species in the Resseliella genus
-   Females lay eggs in damaged parts of soybean stems and larvae eat away at the stem

![](https://assets.syngentaebiz.com/images/SGM%20life%20cycle.jpg){width="50%" fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}

Pronounce resseliella: "ress-a-lee-lla"

Cracks and fissures in the stems of soybeans can happen due to natural growth, plant disease, and from external trauma

:::

## Possible solutions

-   At this time, there are no guaranteed methods for preventing damage due to soybean gall midge

-   One possible method, the subject of today's talk, is to cover the stems of soybeans with dirt

    -   A process known as hilling
    
# Statistical Background


## Generalized Linear Mixed Models 

::: {.incremental}

Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) are a large class of models in experimental design

  - Generalized: account for various types of data, such as counts or proportions

  - Linear: models that can be expressed in the form $\eta=X\beta+Zb$, where $\beta$ is a vector of fixed effect coefficients and $b$ is a vector of random effect coefficients

  - Mixed: models that contain multiple random effects

:::

## Generalized Linear Mixed Models 

  Each term in the model is considered "fixed" or "random"

::: {.incremental}

  - An effect is "random" if it is representative of a larger population, and "fixed" if not

    - For example, consider a field that is sectioned into three parts: A, B, and C
      - If the researchers want to extend the results to other sections, then the effect of the field part is random
      - If the researchers are only interested in parts A, B, and C, then the effect of the field part is fixed
      
:::   

::: {.notes}

Assumes that the sections are representative of a larger population of sections

:::

      
## Generalized Linear Mixed Models 

::: {.incremental}

Each GLMM needs to have a few specifications

  - Distribution of observations: $y|b\sim Normal, Poisson, etc\dots$
    - "What form do the responses take?"
      - Count, proportion, etc.

  - Linear predictor: $\eta=X\beta+Zb$
    - This is how we fit the model to the experimental design
    
  - Link function: $\eta=g(\mu|b)$
    - Where the linear predictor is applied with respect to the distribution of the observations
      - For example, $y|b\sim Poisson(\lambda)$ has a link function of $\eta=\log(\lambda)$. That is, the linear predictor is fit to the log of the mean of the Poisson distribution
    - Maps the responses of the data to real numbers

:::

::: {.notes}

The inverse link function expresses the expected value of the observations as a function of the linear predictor.

Also need the distribution of the random effects, but these are almost always assumed to normal around zero

# A Study on the Effects of Hilling

## Unhilling Study

Two primary research questions:

1)  How does unhilling affect total SGM larvae counts? / Does having a preventative measure earlier in the growing season decrease SGM larvae counts?

2)  How does unhilling affect soybean growth/yield?

  -   Field organized into two rows and two columns, with each section acting as a block

  -   Seven treatments of unhilling dates approximately two weeks apart (one left unhilled at the start of the study as a control)

  -   For (1), larvae counts were taken approximately every two weeks

  -   For (2), growth/yield metrics were taken at the end of the growing season
  
  ![](https://www.dekalbasgrowdeltapine.com/content/dam/knowledge-transfer/en/assets/image-library/infographics/2020090101.jpg){width="25%" fig-align="center"}
  
::: {.notes}

All soybean plants receive hilling (except for control) and the treatment is removing the physical barrier

Each unhilling date roughly corresponds to a different stage of the soybean growth cycle

These studies were conducted in a single field in Nebraska (I would assume at UNL since this is where the the consulting client came from)

## Unhilling Study: Fitted Model (1)

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
    \eta_{ijk}=\eta + \tau_i + S_j + (\tau S)_{ij}  + S(B\tau)_{ijk}
\end{equation}
```
-   Terms are defined the same as the hilling study
-   $y_{ijk}| S(B\tau)_{ijk}\sim Poisson(\lambda_{ijk})$
-   $\eta_{ijk}=\log(\lambda_{ijk})$

Differences marked with an asterisk (\*) are considered marginally significant. There were no other significant simple effect differences for each sample date.

::: {.notes}

All p-values were adjusted with Tukey's honest significant difference. This helps to reduce the probability of Type I errors, which is when we incorrectly detect a difference

:::

## Unhilling Study: Results (1)

![](images/plots/LS-UnhillingRpt-DataScale.png){width="70%" fig-align="center"}

Larger treatment numbers denote a later date for unhilling. Trends indicate that unhilling earlier in the season have larger counts of SGM larvae.

::: {.notes}

Unhilling earlier in the season tends to increase the SGM larvae counts. 

:::

## Unhilling Study: Fitted Model (2)

The full model is presented for the five collected responses. These are count of soybean nodes, pods, seeds, and plant height and seed weight.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
    \eta_{ijk}=\eta + B_i + \tau_j + (B\tau)_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk}
\end{equation}
```
Where

-   $\eta$ is the intercept

-   $B_i\sim N(0, \sigma^2_B)$ is the effect of the $i^{th}$ field section (block)

-   $\tau_j$ is the effect of the $j^{th}$ unhilling date

-   $(B\tau)_{ij}\sim N(0, \sigma^2_{B\tau})$ is the interaction effect of the $i^{th}$ field section and the $j^{th}$ unhilling date

-   $\epsilon_{ijk}\sim N(0, \sigma^2_e)$ is the random error of the $i^{th}$ field section, $j^{th}$ unhilling date, and the $k^{th}$ plant

The model is then fit the these specifications

| Response       | Distribution                    | Link Function              | Changes from full model                              |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Count of nodes | $y|B\sim Poisson(\lambda)$      | $\eta_{i}=\log(\lambda_i)$ | Removal of $B_i$ and $\epsilon_{ijk}$                |
| Soybean height | $y|B\sim Normal(\mu, \sigma^2)$ | $\eta_{i}=\mu_i$           | Use of CS covariance structure instead of $B_i$ term |
| Count of pods  | $y|B\sim Negbin(\lambda)$       | $\eta_{i}=\log(\lambda_i)$ | Removal of $B_i$ term and $\epsilon_{ijk}$; KR2      |
| Seed weight    | $y|B\sim Normal(\mu, \sigma^2)$ | $\eta_{i}=\mu_i$           | No adjustments                                       |
| Count of seeds | $y|B\sim Negbin(\lambda)$       | $\eta_{i}=\log(\lambda_i)$ | Removal of $B_i$ term and $\epsilon_{ijk}$; KR2      |


::: {.notes}

We will only talk about soybean height and the count of seeds. The other responses follow similar patterns.

# Discussion

## Discussion

:::{.incremental}
- Infestation has possibility to cause ecological and economical harm

- Protecting soybean stems via hilling earlier in the season decreased SGM larvae counts and improved soybean growth/yield metrics when there was an active SGM infestation

- No method completely prevented SGM larvae from getting into the stems

# STAT 930 Reflection

## STAT 930 Reflection

::: {.incremental}

- Good clients overall this semester

- No follow-ups with clients

- Some issues with communications
  - A couple of clients either "ghosted" me or took a long time to reply
  
- Client projects
  1) Measurements on different types of asphalt
      - One factor experiments where there were sometimes one experimental unit
  2) Survey data on crop fields with a particular disease
      - Lots of graphs and tables to answer "what are some commonalities in the data?"
      - Directed to NEAR center for future surveys
      - Client not sure of research question
  3) Bike trails and improvements on quality of life metrics
      - Small sample size and nothing was significant
  4) Soybean pest infestation (project from today's talk)
      - Many GLMMs
      - Models did not converge with "full models."
