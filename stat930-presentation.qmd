## Soybean Background

-   Soybean is an essential crop in the United States
-   Used for food and oil
    -   Primarily for feeding livestock and producing cooking oil

# Soybean Gall Midge

## A new pest

-   In 2011, there were reports of an unidentified orange larvae on the stems of damaged soybeans after a hailstorm
-   Entomologists received reports of larvae infestations in 2018 for an unknown species causing significant damage

![](images/larvae.jpg){width="50%" fig-align="center"}

## A new pest

-   Initial surveys indicated the infestation was in Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, and Nebraska
-   As of 2020, the insect was identified in 114 counties, now including Missouri

![](images/locations.jpeg){width="75%" fig-align="center"}

## A new pest

-   Initially found on damaged plants at the end of the growing season, causing little economic concern
-   In 2018, an infestation warranted further concerns when a sample of damaged plants from earlier in the growing season had no other detectable plant diseases
-   Insects were identified as a new species in the Resseliella genus
-   Females lay eggs in damaged parts of soybean stems (including naturally occurring fissures) and larvae eat away at the stem

![](https://assets.syngentaebiz.com/images/SGM%20life%20cycle.jpg){width="50%" fig-align="center"}

## Possible solutions

-   At this time, there are no guaranteed methods for preventing damage due to soybean gall midge

-   One possible method, the subject of today's talk, is to cover the stems of soybeans with dirt

    -   A process known as hilling

# Two Studies on the Effects of Hilling

## Hilling Study

Does hilling at a particular stage in the soybean growth cycle help to decrease the number of soybean gall midge (SGM) larvae?

-   In 2022, a study was conducted as a randomized complete block design (RCBD) and measured the count of SGM larvae.
    -   An infested field had four rows where each row was used as a block
    -   Within each field row, four treatments were randomly applied to a section
        -   No hilling (control)
        -   Hilling at V2, V5, and R2 soybean growth stages
    -   Measurements were taken at approximately two-week intervals

![](https://www.dekalbasgrowdeltapine.com/content/dam/knowledge-transfer/en/assets/image-library/infographics/2020090101.jpg){width="25%" fig-align="center"}

## Hilling Study: Fitted Model

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
    \eta_{ijk}=\eta + \tau_i + S_j + (\tau S)_{ij} + (B \tau)_{ik} + S(B\tau)_{ijk}
\end{equation}
```
Where

-   $\eta$ is the intercept

-   $\tau_i$ is the $i^{th}$ hilling date

-   $S_j$ is the $j^{th}$ sample date

-   $(\tau S)_{ij}$ is the interaction between the $i^{th}$ hilling date and the $j^{th}$ sample date

-   $(B \tau)_{ik}\sim N(0, \sigma^2_{A})$ is the random interaction effect between the $i^{th}$ treatment and the $k^{th}$ field row

-   $S(B\tau)_{ijk}\sim N(0, \sigma^2_{B})$ is the random effect of the $i^{th}$ hilling date, $j^{th}$ sample date, and the $k^{th}$ row

-   Distribution: $y_{ijk}|(B \tau)_{ij}, S(B\tau)_{ijk}\sim Poisson(\lambda_{ijk})$, where $y_{ijk}$ is the count of SGM larvae

-   Link function: $\eta_{ijk}=\log(\lambda_{ijk})$

## Hilling Study: Results

![](images/plots/LS-Hilling-ModelScale.png){width="50%" fig-align="center"}

-   Some evidence of interaction between sample date and timing for application of hilling
-   Only a few differences detected
    -   July 5, differences between control and V2 (Treatments 1 and 2, p-value = .0203) and between V2 and R2 (Treatments 2 and 4, p-value = .0351)
-   Possible evidence that hilling at the V2 stage help reduce SGM larvae counts?

## Unhilling Study

Two primary research questions:

1)  How does unhilling affect total SGM larvae counts? / Does having a preventative measure earlier in the growing season decrease SGM larvae counts?

2)  How does unhilling affect soybean growth/yield?

-   Study design is similar to the hilling study (RCBD)

    -   Field organized into two rows and two columns, with each section acting as a block

    -   Seven treatments of unhilling dates approximately two weeks apart (one left unhilled at the start of the study as a control)

    -   For (1), larvae counts were taken approximately every two weeks

    -   For (2), growth/yield metrics were taken at the end of the growing season

## Unhilling Study: Fitted Model (1)

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
    \eta_{ijk}=\eta + \tau_i + S_j + (\tau S)_{ij}  + S(B\tau)_{ijk}
\end{equation}
```
-   Terms are defined the same as the hilling study
-   $y_{ijk}| S(B\tau)_{ijk}\sim Poisson(\lambda_{ijk})$
-   $\eta_{ijk}=\log(\lambda_{ijk})$

Larger treatment numbers denote a later date for unhilling. Trends indicate that unhilling earlier in the season have larger counts of SGM larvae.

## Unhilling Study: Fitted Model (2)

The full model is presented for the five collected responses. These are count of soybean nodes, pods, seeds, and plant height and seed weight.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
    \eta_{ijk}=\eta + B_i + \tau_j + (B\tau)_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk}
\end{equation}
```
Where

-   $\eta$ is the intercept

-   $B_i\sim N(0, \sigma^2_B)$ is the effect of the $i^{th}$ field section (block)

-   $\tau_j$ is the effect of the $j^{th}$ unhilling date

-   $(B\tau)_{ij}\sim N(0, \sigma^2_{B\tau})$ is the interaction effect of the $i^{th}$ field section and the $j^{th}$ unhilling date

-   $\epsilon_{ijk}\sim N(0, \sigma^2_e)$ is the random error of the $i^{th}$ field section, $j^{th}$ unhilling date, and the $k^{th}$ plant

The model is then fit the these specifications

| Response       | Distribution                    | Link Function              | Changes from full model                              |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Count of nodes | $y|B\sim Poisson(\lambda)$      | $\eta_{i}=\log(\lambda_i)$ | Removal of $B_i$ and $\epsilon_{ijk}$                |
| Soybean height | $y|B\sim Normal(\mu, \sigma^2)$ | $\eta_{i}=\mu_i$           | Use of CS covariance structure instead of $B_i$ term |
| Count of pods  | $y|B\sim Negbin(\lambda)$       | $\eta_{i}=\log(\lambda_i)$ | Removal of $B_i$ term and $\epsilon_{ijk}$; KR2      |
| Seed weight    | $y|B\sim Normal(\mu, \sigma^2)$ | $\eta_{i}=\mu_i$           | No adjustments                                       |
| Count of seeds | $y|B\sim Negbin(\lambda)$       | $\eta_{i}=\log(\lambda_i)$ | Removal of $B_i$ term and $\epsilon_{ijk}$; KR2      |

## Unhilling Study: Results (2) - Soybean Seed Count

![](images/plots/LS-SeedCount.png){width="70%"}

Similar to soybean height, unhilling earlier in the season generally decreased soybean seed counts

# Discussion

## Discussion

:::{.incremental}
- Infestation has possibility to cause ecological and economical harm

- Protecting soybean stems via hilling earlier in the season decreased SGM larvae counts and improved soybean growth/yield metrics when there was an active SGM infestation

- No method completely prevented SGM larvae from getting into the stems
